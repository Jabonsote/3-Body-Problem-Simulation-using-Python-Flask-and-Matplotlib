# 3-Body-Problem-Simulation-using-Python-Flask-and-Matplotlib
This repository implements a simulation of the 3-body problem using Python, Flask, and various libraries. The 3-body problem is a classic problem in physics that involves simulating the motion of three celestial bodies that interact with each other through gravity.
